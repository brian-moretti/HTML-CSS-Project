# HTML-CSS-Project by Brian Moretti

I'm a student of Start 2 Impact University and this is my 1Â° project for the Master "Front End Developer"

## About the project

The project is the creation of a WebSite Portfolio using only HTML/CSS

## About the project

The Website is build using only HTML & CSS, SASS as processor
No frameworks or other CSS external libraries are used.

## Development Process

I get some ideas of the structure seeing others portfolio's website around the Web. Of course I had to make a compromise of what I can and what I'm able to do.
